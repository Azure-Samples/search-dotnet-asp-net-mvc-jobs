We deliver 1.1 billion gallons of high quality drinking water per day to 8.3 million New York City residents and more than 1 million people in Upstate New York, and we collect and treat an average of 1.3 billion gallons of wastewater per day.    The Bureau of Water Supply seeks to hire a City Research Scientist (CRS) II within the Division of Water Quality Science and Research (WQSR) to be located in the Bureauâ€™s Kingston, New York offices. The focus of this position will be to contribute to new research initiatives by improving operation of the water supply system to 1) address increasingly stringent regulatory requirements on disinfection byproducts (DBP) and 2) employ tools that will allow WSQR to analyze high-frequency data collected by the Robotic Monitoring program. DEP seeks to enhance knowledge of dissolved organic carbon sources and dynamics in the NYC reservoir watersheds as related to DBP formation potential. This knowledge will inform DEPâ€™s water quality modeling efforts and influence operational decisions. DEP also seeks to make use of readily available computing resources to analyze high-frequency data.     Under direction of the Section Chief for Program Evaluation and Planning, with broad scope for independent initiative and judgment, the responsibilities and tasks for the City Research Scientist II in this position will involve difficult technical work as an individual contributor on two major initiatives noted above.

In NYC, it is estimated that more than 60,000 residential units were damaged by Hurricane Sandy.  New York City's Build it Back Program provides reconstruction, rehabilitation, and reimbursement assistance to all Build it Back-registered residential buildings impacted by Hurricane Sandy, from single family homes to high-density multifamily housing, as well as rental assistance to displaced low-income tenants. The Federal government has allocated $4.22 billion in Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) funds to the City, of which $2.34 billion has been allocated for housing recovery. The Multifamily Storm Recovery  Program provides CDBG-DR funds to reimburse owners for completed repairs, repair any remaining Sandy damage, and complete resiliency improvements on targeted developments.  The Multifamily Storm Recovery Program includes a broad group of more than 500 projects, which include rental buildings, condominium developments, and cooperatives that were damaged by Sandy. Projects range in size from individual condo/coop units to developments with 5 to 1,500 or more units.    HPD has also partnered with three Community Development Finance Institutions (CDFIs) as sub-grantees/recipients to provide funds to the affected buildings: the Community Preservation Corporation (CPC), the Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC) and the New York City Housing Development Corporation (NYC HDC).

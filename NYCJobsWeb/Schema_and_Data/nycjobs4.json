To reduce HIV transmission and HIV-related morbidity and mortality, accurate case surveillance data are required to guide public health decision-making and to allocate resources for HIV prevention and treatment and support services for HIV-infected persons.  Surveillance data are primarily generated through legally mandated population-based HIV surveillance. The HIV Epidemiology and Field Services Program of the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene processes >6,000 provider  and 800,000 laboratory reports annually, generating more than 12,000 field investigations, 2500 new diagnoses of HIV and 2,000 new diagnoses of AIDS each year.  In addition to standard case surveillance, the program conducts two important supplemental surveillance activities â€“ incidence and resistance surveillance.  Incidence surveillance uses a CDC statistical algorithm coupled with a laboratory test that can distinguish between early and chronic infection to estimate HIV incidence, thereby assisting the agency to track the numbers and characteristics of persons who are becoming infected now and permitting the targeting of prevention resources to hyperendemic populations. Resistance surveillance uses legally mandated nucleotide sequence reporting to track the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance among newly diagnosed persons and acquired resistance among those with established infections.    The program seeks a City Research Scientist I to assist the HIV Incidence and Resistance team with data management and analysis, estimation of incident infection (vs. incident diagnosis) and estimation of transmitted drug resistance.

To effectively reduce HIV transmission and HIV-related morbidity and mortality, accurate data are required to guide public health decision-making.  HIV/AIDS surveillance data are used to guide the allocation of millions of dollars in federal, state and city resources targeted for HIV prevention as well as treatment and support services for HIV-infected persons.  New York City prevention, treatment and care resource allocation recommendations are developed by two planning bodies composed of representatives of government agencies, non-governmental experts, patient representatives and advocates, and community-based organizations.  The HIV Epidemiology and Field Services Program, which maintains the HIV/AIDS Registry and monitors the epidemic in New York City, provides data, reports, interpretation and counsel to these planning bodies.   The federal prevention portfolio is allocated by the HIV Prevention Planning Group (HPG), and the federal treatment and care portfolio is allocated by the Ryan White Planning Council (RWPC).   Each group has a community and government co-chair and members representing governmental and non-governmental agencies and interests.    The HIV Epidemiology and Field Services Program is recruiting a senior scientist to serve as its Epidemiologic Liaison to these planning groups.
